# XR Fashion City Simulation (GitHub Pages Demo)

This project is a simulation environment for the AR (Augmented Reality) features of the main [SHEYOU Virtual Space application](https://susu-virtual-space.web.app/).

## Purpose

This version is intended for:

- **Public Demonstration:** To showcase the AR interactions and 3D model viewing capabilities on GitHub Pages.
- **Development & Emulation:** It simulates the experience a user would have when they physically arrive at a designated AR location within the main application.

It is a modified version of the core `virtual_space` codebase, adapted to run as a static site on GitHub Pages and may have certain backend-dependent features (like live Firebase data synchronization) disabled or mocked.

The primary application, with full Firebase integration and live deployment, can be found at [susu-virtual-space.web.app](https://susu-virtual-space.web.app/).
